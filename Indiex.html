        <h2>What is the Hyphy Movement?</h2>
        <p>The Hyphy Movement is a cultural movement that started in the Bay Area during the early 2000s. Known for its music, dance, and street culture, it was a celebration of life and freedom. Pioneered by legends like Mac Dre and Andrew Nicotina, the movement captured the spirit of Northern California.</p>
